All analysis is done via run_anaylsis.R.

The test, training, subject and activity files were combined. Only the variables with mean or std values were considered for inclusion.

A second data set, (indy_tidy_data.txt) is included and is the average of each variable, for each subject and activity.

For a description of each variable included, see codebook.md.
